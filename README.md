## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a self-motivated and detail-oriented Software Developer with **2+ years** of hands-on experience in both backend and frontend development.  
I specialize in **ASP.NET Core**, **Blazor**, **Clean Architecture**, and **Microservices**, with solid experience in **API-first development**, **RabbitMQ**, and **Docker**.

I work with technologies like:
- ✅ **ASP.NET Core Web API / MVC / Razor Pages**
- ✅ **Blazor Server & WASM**
- ✅ **SQL Server, Redis, PostgreSQL**
- ✅ **Angular & Vue.js (growing skills)**
- ✅ **GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, xUnit, Moq**

I enjoy building scalable, maintainable software solutions, and continuously learning new tools and practices to grow as a developer.
